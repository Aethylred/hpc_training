Software packages that were installed on FitzRoy will be available on Kupe (HPC3).
The full list of available software will be provided in due course.

### Requesting software installation
If the software package which is not installed on Kupe, please email support@nesi.org.nz If the software can run / be compiled for Kupe and there are not licensing restrictions, we are usually able to make it available to you in reasonably short time. Occiassionally, we may need more time to investigate the licensing set up  (for example, if the licensing server is provided through your organisation.)

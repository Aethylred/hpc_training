Most software packages installed on FitzRoy will be available on Kupe (HPC3).
The list of available software can be obtained with the 
```
module avail

command. 

### Requesting software installation
If you need a software package and it is not installed on Kupe, please email support@nesi.org.nz. If the software can be compiled on Kupe, runs there and there are no licensing restrictions, we will make every effort to install the software within days. Occasionally, we may need more time to investigate the licensing set up (for example, if the licensing server is provided through your organisation.)
